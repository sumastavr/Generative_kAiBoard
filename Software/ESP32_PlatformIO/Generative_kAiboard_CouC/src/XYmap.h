//              2014-10-18 - code version 2c (local table, holes are r/w), 
//              by Mark Kriegsman 
//
//              This special 'XY' code lets you program the RGB Shades
//              as a plain 16x5 matrix.  
//
//              Writing to and reading from the 'holes' in the layout is 
//              also allowed; holes retain their data, it's just not displayed.
//
//              You can also test to see if you're on or off the layout
//              like this
//                if( XY(x,y) > LAST_VISIBLE_LED ) { ...off the layout...}
//
//              X and Y bounds checking is also included, so it is safe
//              to just do this without checking x or y in your code:
//                leds[ XY(x,y) ] == CRGB::Red;
//              All out of bounds coordinates map to the first hidden pixel.
//
//     XY(x,y) takes x and y coordinates and returns an LED index number,
//             for use like this:  leds[ XY(x,y) ] == CRGB::Red;


// Params for width and height
const uint8_t kMatrixWidth = 16;
const uint8_t kMatrixHeight = 5;

#define NUM_LEDS (kMatrixWidth * kMatrixHeight)
CRGB leds[ NUM_LEDS ];


// This function will return the right 'led index number' for 
// a given set of X and Y coordinates on your RGB Shades. 
// This code, plus the supporting 80-byte table is much smaller 
// and much faster than trying to calculate the pixel ID with code.

#define LAST_VISIBLE_LED 79

uint8_t XY( uint8_t x, uint8_t y){
  // any out of bounds address maps to the first hidden pixel
  if( (x >= kMatrixWidth) || (y >= kMatrixHeight) ) {
    Serial.println("OVERFLOW");
    return (LAST_VISIBLE_LED+1);
